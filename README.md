**Useage**
This Network's soul purpose as of now is to determine if the photo its analysing is a photo of me, or a photo of
one of my family members.

**Repurpose**
To repurpose it, youll need to make some slight edits to the inputs, number of layers, size of layers, and
code (like the hashmap in network->testNetwork)

**License**
You can use the code for whatever you'd like so long as you dont steal/take credit for it and you dont sell it.
