-- To Do --

1) Backpropogation/Some way to optimize weights
2) Compute time optimizations (2c/s)
3) Threading (Could be apart of '2')
4) Multipurposing network class (beyond just analysing data)
5) Image generation (Potentially apart of '4')


--
Start at weights of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..ect]
change w[0] by step every frame and get value
find optimal step for w[0] until it cant get any better
repeat for w[1-i]
