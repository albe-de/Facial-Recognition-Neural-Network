-- To Do --

1) Backpropogation/Some way to optimize weights (below)
2) Compute time optimizations (2c/s) -> threading/multiprocessing
4) Image generation/repurposing network


--
Start at weights of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..ect]
change w[0] by step every frame and get value
find optimal step for w[0] until it cant get any better
repeat for w[1-i]

-- Experimental data
[len, 10, 2] -> 50-82 avg 70
[len, 16, 8, 2] -> 40-60 avg 48
[len, 16, 2] -> 50-64 avg 56
[len, 2] -> 5-20 avg 15
